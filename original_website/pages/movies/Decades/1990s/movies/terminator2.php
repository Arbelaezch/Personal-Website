				I'll make this a simple review. This is a great film. Its not just one of the best action films ever made, but it also deals with deep themes of what it means to be human, the conflicts between children and their parents and the classic tale of the inevitability of the end of human civilization. If you have not yet seen Terminator 2, I strongly recommend that you do.

				<br><br>
				This is such a perfect movie it would honestly be faster to discuss whats wrong with it rather than what isn't. The final fight scene drags on a little too long for my taste. There. thats the only thing wrong with this film.

				<br><br>
				You wanna know what director James Cameron gets right? Arnold Shwarzenegger is the ultimate action star and every scene he's in is unmissable. The relationship between him and John Connor is simultaneously hilarous and heartbreaking. The two literally could have carried the entire movie themselves. However, Linda Hamilton is also phenomenal going through a full body and personality transformation from the last film. Her character is deeply damaged and initially draws pity, but inevitably regains her humanity through her son and her new found family. The massive set pieces are not only explosive and epic, but also iconic. There's not an action sequence in here that feels generic or wasted. Any other action film is lucky to showcase even one fight sequence as engaging as the ones Terminator 2 pulls off with ease. And finally, these sequences are as engaging as they are because of such an unstoppable antagonist. The T-1000 is a force of nature that cannot be stopped, including by Schwarzenegger himself. This makes the entire film a tense ride that elevates the action from simply grandiose, to gripping. 

				<br><br>
				Don't even bother with the first one if you haven't seen it yet. Just do yourself a favor and watch this film.
