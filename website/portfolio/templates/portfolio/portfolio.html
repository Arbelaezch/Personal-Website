                My technical expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with professional experience in Python, JavaScript, React, and Django. I've successfully deployed and maintained applications across various platforms, from cloud services (Google Cloud Platform, Digital Ocean) to on-premises solutions using nginx and gunicorn. My background includes working with C/C++, Java, and SQL, complemented by modern web technologies like Next.js and comprehensive database management with MySQL. Recently, I've been exploring data science and machine learning, expanding my skillset to embrace emerging technologies in the field.

                    Hi, I'm Christian Arbelaez, a Full-stack Software Developer at the University of Alberta Students' Union with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business from the University of Alberta.
                    <br><br>
                    My journey in technology began early, from building custom PCs in high school to developing enterprise-level web applications today. I combine my technical expertise with a strong business acumen, which I developed through both my academic background and years of personal investment experience.
                    <br><br>
                    As a developer, I thrive on continuous learning and problem-solving. Whether it's mastering a new technology stack or optimizing existing systems, I approach each challenge methodically - first through thorough research and understanding, then through practical application and refinement.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond coding, I'm passionate about classical films, ancient history, and practical philosophy. I maintain this website as a platform to showcase both my professional work and personal interests, offering a comprehensive view of my technical capabilities and creative pursuits.
