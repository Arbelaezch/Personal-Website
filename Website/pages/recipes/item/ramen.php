          Coming in at a whopping twenty cents per package, these noodles are 
          a great low cost meal that take a whole ten minutes to 
          get from package to your mouth. Don't think just because 
          its quick and easy means its any less delicious, though.
          This single serving dish is delightful to the last noodle.

          Serves one very happy individual

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Cook noodles in boiling water on high for 1-2min or until just breaking up</li>
            <li>Heat to low and add egg and package of broth (I add half a package for reduced sodium)</li>
            <li>Add any meats or oils/sauces</li>
            <li>Put a lid on the pot and wait for another minute or two, until water is at desire level</li>
            <li>Pour noodles into eating bowl and top with green onions and cheese if desired</li>
            <li>And there you have it. I recommend waiting five minutes for it to cool off (a perfect amount to time 
              to clean the dishes) and enjoy!
