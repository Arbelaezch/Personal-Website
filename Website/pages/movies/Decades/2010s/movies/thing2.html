				So I'll be honest with you, this movie had no real chance. I tried going in with an open mind and non-judgemntal or whatever but it's impossible when you're following possibly the greatest horror film of all time. The Thing (2011) is a prequel to the horror classic The Thing (1982), which I already have a review for on this website that sums up my thoughts on it sooo I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not going to talk about the 1982 version's pioneering and ambitious practical effects or its expert use of tension. Instead I'm going to talk about all of the computer generated effects of the modern version :D

				<br><br>

				Now I'm not one of those "CGI bad, practical good hur dur" guys, but in a horror film you need to believe what you are seeing in order to be scared by it. Or if you're not scared by the film's effects, then you at least need to be creeped out by the plot and underlying tension. Otherwise, you are not scared and it is therefore a bad horror movie. I'm not going to get into comedy horror or campy horror because this film does not take either of those angles; it instead opts for the Boring Horror route. As mentioned, the CGI monster is unconvincing and often generic "alien." The character drama was mostly lost on me as well, as you already know it's a prequel going in and so everyone here must die.
				
				<br><br>

				Let me be clear, however. This is not a bad movie. It is made pretty well, with the CGI not being totally horrendous. Some of the creature designs and kills are actually pretty cool as well. The acting is fine, even if much of the writing is transparently predictable. I did also like for the most part the, mostly overt, nods to the original. While pretty obvious, in a bunch of ways you can see that there is a sort of respect for the original here, rather than just a souless cash grab. Like the 2011 version could have easily had the blood test again for fan service, but instead the writers put their brain cells together to come up with a legitimately original idea that I thought was easily the best section of the film.
				
				<br><br>

				My problem with this film lies in that it is boring. Give me a horrendously bad horror movie any day of the week over this mostly generic, predictable, safe horror flick. It does nothing terribly new or exciting and VERY much lives in its predecessor's shadow. Even the poster is basically an exact copy of the original's, and yet it still has less personality. In my opinion it's greatest positive is that it fills in some of the lore around the world of The Thing and God knows I love my lore. But the truth is I will never watch this again because it is just so 'meh.' And to me that is a greater sin than being an abomination dumpster fire.
