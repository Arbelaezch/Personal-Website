				Spectre is Daniel Craig's fourth outing as Bond and Bond's 24th showing. At nearly $300 million dollars, it was the most expensive Bond film ever made and one of the most expensive films ever, as of October 2021. Sam Smith's theme song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It also made a pretty penny as, at the time, the second highest grossing Bond of all time after Skyfall.

				<br><br>

				Honestly, fuck this movie. It had all the makings of a fantastic picture: Sam Mendes returning to direct, Craig still in the prime of his career, a beautiful set up from Skyfall with a new M, Moneypenny, and Q, and one of the hottest actors in Hollywood at the time, Christoph Waltz, playing the leader of the haunting reincarnation of the "legendary" villainous organization, Spectre. They even had an incredible opening shot and action sequence to completely throw you off that what was to follow would be complete garbage.

				<br><br>

				This movie makes absolutely no sense. From the villains clearly not even trying to kill Bond when they would otherwise have him dead to rights, the lameduck relationship between Craig and Seydoux, the pointless pinache and theatrics of Waltz's villainous plots to kill Bond. My god it is too much to handle. Nothing about how characters act in this movie makes any sense if they were truly trying to kill Bond.

				<br><br>

				I don't require Bond films to be deep, introspective or even have great story's to them. I've come back to this franchise 24 times because they are easily digestible action flicks with a hero that I can pretend to empathize with when truthfully there is nobody on earth like Bond. But the absolute base line of an action movie is that is has to make sense. If the villain says you have three minutes and can only either save yourself, or save the girl you love, the hero should not be able to do both just because without any other explanation about how. Bond can fall in love, absolutely, we all agreed with that back in Casino Royale, but please for the love of god make their romance last more than two days. And why does this sudden power of love enable Bond to run around sniping enemies with a GD machine gun??

				<br><br>

				I'm not upset with this movie because it's bad. I've seen far worse pictures before. I'm upset with it because it had so much promise. There was so much possibility here for a great movie, and yet it isn't even good. At two and a half hours, I will make it a point to never waste my time on this ever again.
