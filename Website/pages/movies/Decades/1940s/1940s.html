                    A period of escapism where people chose to watch movies during The Depression as they were cheap. 
                    Popular genres were Screwball Comedies, Westerns, and Musicals. 
                    Studios aimed to push boundaries and have the most exciting films possible, but this became
                    difficult when Haye's Code was established in 1934 by the American government. 
                    Haye's Code put certain censorship rules on studios such as no pointed swearing, lustful kissing 
                    and you had to be careful about theft and robbery. This forced Studios to be creative when trying to 
                    push the boundary. Studios took another hit when the American government declared that 
                    Studios were in 
                    violation of Trust Laws (having a monopoly on film entertainment) and were forced to sell their theater holdings. 
                    Now they could only focus on production and distribution, not Theatre showings.
                
                    <br><br>

                    Despite these setbacks however, Studios still had near unlimited freedom to produce artistic, commercially successful films 
                    that still stand the test of time as some of the best ever made. The introduction of Color in 1939 also upped the ante for films, 
                    allowing audiences to further engage with the pictures they were watching.
                    <br><br>

                    Fun Fact: As people moved out of urban centers and into the suburbs, 
                    studios switched to purchasing drive in movie theaters in order to distribute their films.
