                    <p> Audiences at this time went to films not for their narratives or stories, but for their spectacle. This period can be considered 
                        "cinema of attractions." People were shocked by the things happening on screen, which were generally under a minute long and 
                        usually just one scene. Something like a scene from everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or slapstick.
                        There was no real cinematic technique during this period so to engage audiences many films from this time were hand painted. 
                        Films would also use orchestras and performers to score and explain what was happening on the screen. 
                        And finally intertitles became commonplace to provide dialogue / narration.
                        <br><br>

                        The cinema industry was built around the novelty of moving pictures. 
                        Films were a relatively cheap way of providing entertainment to people all over the world. 
                        As demand for more films grew, studios started focusing on mass production rather than whether it was good or not. 
                        Producers watched over these productions and made sure development quotas were met. 
                        Eventually people wanted better, and so better narratives became commonplace.
