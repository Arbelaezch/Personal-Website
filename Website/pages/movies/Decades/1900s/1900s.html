            <p>Upon initial release Up was met with insane critical and commercial success, cementing itself as one of The 
                Greats within Pixar's, at the time, spotless resume of classics. Of course since 2009 Pixar has gone from consistently releasing
                films that pioneer and reinvent the Animated genre to putting out far less innovative works that are often sequels to prior
                franchises. These works, while never the bottom of the barrel of animated entertainment, are far from the impressive heights
                that Pixar was previously attaining on a yearly basis. This tainting of Pixar's good name has shown doubt on even their
                greatest hits as edgy film critics claim Pixar was "never that good." Apart of these cynics' opinions is often that the
                only reason Up is good is because of the opening ten minutes. I am here to convince you that these people could not be more wrong.
