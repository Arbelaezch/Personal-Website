          <p> One of the first feature films with a synchronized musical score and sound effects soundtrack. 
              Also won Oscars for Unique and Artistic Picture (Best Picture before it was called BP), Actress, and Cinematography. 
              The cinematography Oscar is very much earned as it is an absolutely beautiful film that does a 
              wonderful job of conveying meaning as there are very few title cards, which is very much appreciated. 
              A couple of noteworthy moments are one where the main characters stand in the street with cars dashing by 
              them and another where the couple is on a boat in the middle of a storm. Cinematographically, this movie blows
               others out of the water!
               <br><br>

               Unfortunately like so many other films during this era that I love, Sunrise was a box office flop. 
               Well at least it was critically received well because it is absolutely beautiful and a joy to watch.
