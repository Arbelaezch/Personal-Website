                coming of a savior to mediate their differences.<br><br>

            One of the early epic science fiction pictures to wow audiences with it's pioneering special effects. 
              Techniques such as using miniature models of the city, using a camera on a swing, a giant robot costume worn by
              an actor, and finally the Shufftan Process, which uses mirrors to create the illusion that actors
               are occupying miniature sets. However, even with these novel effects for the time and its enormous budget, Metropolis
               was still released to mixed reception from critics and audiences. People heralded it as beautiful and visually powerful
                but lacking in story, with some going as far as to call the story trite and silly. Of course nowadays people 
                claim it is one of the best science fiction pictures of the age, and for good reason.<br><br>

               The film was born from its director, Fritz Lang seeing the skyscrapers in New York City. Writer Thea von Harbou 
               also took inspiration for the plot from World War 1, as well as the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. With Metropolis 
               Harbou and Lang attempted to explore themes of industrialization and mass production and their effects on society as well as 
               how they impacted the war. <br><br>

               Personally, I found Metropolis to be far too long. At first I could appreciate the special effects, as well as the scale 
               of the project. But a two and a half hour runtime is just far too long to be propped up by effects. While it was an epic at one time, 
               its long since become obsolete in effects and message, with industrialization taking a back seat to Artificial Intelligence in our 
               "new age."
