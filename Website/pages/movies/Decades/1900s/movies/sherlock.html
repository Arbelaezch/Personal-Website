          <p> An incredibly fun, accessible adventure that still holds audience engagement to this day! 
              Cinematography wise there are dream sequences, cutting between different scenes that take place 
              at the same time, moving shots, and a theatre scene that needs to be seen to be believed.
              I am super impressed. But this film goes beyond simple camera work, it instead rests on its 
              incredibly funny gags and stoic lead, Keaton. Near singlehandedly, Keaton brings you into 
              a story that actually grips and makes you feel for its participants. 
              <br><br>

              Nearly all of the story is told through physical acting / visuals so there is not much reading involved. 
              Your time as a viewer is not wasted, but instead rewarded through clever visual cues that keep your eyes glued
              and your attention piqued. And not to mention the bike scene at the end oh my god! 
              I cannot believe some of the stunts. Truly impressive.<br><br>

              The most heartbreaking thing about this entire picture is that it was not initially received well and was
               considered a box office failure. The only question I have is, HOW???
