          <p> Made at the end of the silent era, Buster Keaton's magnum opus picture was a critical and 
              box office failure that lost Keaton his independence as a filmmaker. The General substitutes 
              some of the comedy from Sherlock Jr. for a much stronger dramatic narrative. This was to the dismay of the
               audience which was expecting to leave the theatre in stitches. <br><br>
            
            
              I too personally think it loses something in the trade off. The General is massive and 
                tense and shocking at times, but Sherlock was just clean and tight. I think The General can't stand on the drama 
                as successfully as Sherlock can stand on the comedy. Not to say that Keaton didn't make a highly engaging 
                drama that I think outshines almost anything else in the 20s. Its just comparing the succinct, rapid fire
                comedy of Sherlock Jr. to the far grander, slower comedy-narrative duo of The General, I'm gonna pick Sherlock 
                nine times outta ten. Either way I still really enjoyed it and still admire and respect Keaton's dedication to the gag. 
                Charlie Chaplin eat your heart out.
