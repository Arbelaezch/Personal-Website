                both fighting in opposite armies. The development of the war in their lives plays through to 
                Lincoln's assassination and the birth of the Ku Klux Klan.

            A true spectacle that is and alwasy has been marred in controversy. 
            Even at the time of release it was considered vile propaganda, sparking riots across the States. 
            It was a film that revitalized the Klan and anti-immigration movements.

            <br><br>

            While, at the same time, it was and is a truly massive spectacle piece that 
            signalled the birth of long form narrative film in America and remained the highest grossing American film until
            Gone With the Wind in 1939. The film features close up shots along side massive military skirmishes and a sprawling story
            that covers the breadth of the entire country. It also rests at a comfortable three hours long, making it a highly
            irregular Epic for the time.

              
            <br><br>

            Overall, it is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever remain the haunting shadow of every American made film going forward.
