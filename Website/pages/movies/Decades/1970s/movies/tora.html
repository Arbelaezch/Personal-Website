            Tora! Tora! Tora! is a mostly accurate, historic retelling of the attack on Pearl Harbor and how all the pieces were put in place for such a informational bumble to happen. It was nominated for five Academy Awards and won for Special Effects. While the film eventually became a financial success, it is still considered somewhat critically divisive. While it is frequently praised for its superb practical effects, critics complain that there are no characters to emotionally identify with.

            While I agree that there is no emotional anchor to this film, I also believe it doesn't need one, nor should it have one. I am a big history nerd and I personally love watching the first half of this film for its slow, almost chess like pace. There is a sense of dread pervaiding the entire first half of this film and following every decision made. Over the course of an hour and a half you watch as every painful decision builds into what audiences know will be a tremendous mistake for the Americans as well as the Japanese. I love watching this methodical chess match being played between the two sides, and appreciate the accuracy and candid nature of each side's perspectives.

            <br><br>


            Honestly, I wish there were more films like this that made a real effort to recount the steps that lead to monumental moments in history. There is a weight in each minute detail that is lost once the film has become too "Hollywoodized." Adding a charasmatic protagonist for the audience to root for would have only managed to make this a subpar action film, rather than the war epic that it truly is. I can understand the desire for an emotional anchor in a massive scale war film like this, but I think to expect that from Tora! would be to miss the point. Director Richard Fleischer is not trying to make a Hollywood blockbuster here. He is trying to make an action documentary, and I think he succeeds in every way.
