            Eyes Wide Shut is visionary director Stanley Kubrick's final film; he died only six days after screening his final cut for Warner Bros. Initial critical reception was mixed to positive with many critics citing it as one of his weaker works. Despite this though, the film was one of Kubrick's few box office successes. While still regarded as one of Kubrick's lesser works, the tide of opinion is turning and I couldn't agree more. This film is a masterpiece. 

            <br>


            As with most of Kubrick's works, he wants to show a glimpse of reality with about how people truly behave and why. He doesn't want to perpetuate the same explanations that we have assumed, but to really show human behaviour for what it is. In all its magnificently imperfect glory. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick decides to take contemporary marriage and human sexuality and put it under a microscope. The title, Eyes Wide Shut, describes partners in successful relationships as having to live under the guise of being supressed, "regular" people. It means that each partner supresses themselves, each shutting their eyes to the fact that the other is doing the exact same. That being said, this is only my interpretation. Ambiguity in Kubrick films is hardly new, and Eyes Wide shut is no exception. It's a film that requires multiple viewings and even then I wholeheartedly believe it's unlikely two viewers will ever have the exact same interpretation of events.

            <br>

            Inspired by Homer's Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut follows Tom Cruise's character as he encounters many would-be sexual partners that are all versions of his own wife, played by Nicole Kidman. During his odyssey, Cruise must come to terms with the fact that his wife has sexual fantasies about being unfaithful to him. Not exactly a tremendous revelation nowadays and yet it still made me surprisingly uncomfortable as I attempted to empathize with Cruise. In my opinion, this is Kubrick's attempt to open men's eyes to the fact their wives want to have sex with other men too *gasp*. This makes "the female’s desire and the male’s inability to possess or contain it the central anxiety and crisis of the movie."<sup>1</sup>

            <br>

            The film really is like a dream. It Transitions from peaceful drama to sexual fantasy to nightmare on more than a few occasions. The masks in the second party, as well as the score, are haunting. They, along with inconsistent and immoral characters, create an unneasiness that follows through the entire film. At no point was I left comfortable, but some scenes it felt attempted to lull me into a false sense of security, only to have them take a hard left turn into the same old familiar nightmare. I'm in love with this film and its brave dissection of contemporary relationships. I also love the straight line the viewer travels along that is constantly surrounded by ambiguity and the unexplainable. It's a fever dream of a movie that is perfectly staged and delivers an experience like no other.
