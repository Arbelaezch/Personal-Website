          Let me start by saying, I have never enjoyed The Matrix. Back when I had first seen these movies as a kid, I actually preferred the second and third ones because they had more action in them, and because I had dumb baby boy brain. Today, I can easily say that The Matrix...wait for it...is phenomenal *gasp*. I know, who could have known.

          <br><br>
          
          This is maybe the fourth or fifth time I've seen this film and it's the absolute first time I can say I've genuinely appreciated it. Maybe it's because I have gained a much more nuanced and measured view of the world and Matrix's philosophical views on it. More likely though, it's because I've seen John Wick now and I know how much ass Keanu kicks ass. I can now also appreciate the incredible world and story that the Wachowski's created, and how it has come to define an entire generation. Lets start with the good:

          <br><br>

          Keanu really is a lot of fun to watch. He's never been the best actor in the world, and yet hes got a charm about him that makes me just like the guy. I also love Fishbourne's laughably over the top performance, while Carrie-Anne Moss left me wanting a little more from her performance. But maybe that's because she was taking things seriously and not playing a caricature like everyone else.

          <br><br>

          I'm also not exactly being revolutionary when I say that the cinematography is wicked, at least for the time. I can appreciate what this film did for the way films are filmed. Film. Each action sequence is exciting not just because the stakes have been so expertly layed out, but because the cinematography and its pioneering style display these setpieces perfectly. I also really liked the Wachowski's take on Simulation Theory and even more how they were able to so succinctly explain it to both Neo and the audience in an engaging and simple way. This movie could have easily been a clusterfuck if it's central complexities weren't easily understood by the audience. Which leads me into the world building.

          <br><br>

          The Matrix is seeping with it's own world and atmosphere, and considering the art style and production I do believe seeping is the correct term. It's such a grungy disgusting world in so many ways. From the horrendous birthing farms that are covered in rust and filth to the run down warehouses and apartments travelled to in the matrix. And don't get me started on those black leather domineering outfits everyone runs around in. Honestly outfits were probably the thing I liked the least about this film, and yet they fit so perfectly with the tone the film is going for.

          <br><br>


          All in all, I now think the Matrix deserves its status as a revolutionary, definitive picture. It creates such a vivid, real world that expands audience's perceptions of what is possible in both film and real life.
