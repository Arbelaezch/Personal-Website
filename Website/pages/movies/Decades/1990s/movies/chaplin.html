            Chaplin (1992) is a biographical look at the life of possibly the most influencial filmmaker of all time, Charlie Chaplin. The film is directed by Richard Attenborough while Chaplin is played by Robert Downey Jr. who was nominated for an Academy Award for the role. It was also nominated for best Original Score as well as best Art Direction. Despite these nominations, the film had mixed critical reception and was a major box office bomb.

            While Chaplin must be a very difficult person to make a film on, Attenborough succeeds making a film of his life, though not a great one by any means. Getting it out of the way early, Downey Jr. is phenomenal. That's obvious. The guy just exudes charisma and a solemness that is perfect for the film that Attenborough is trying to make. That being said, the film he is trying to make is a tough paradox to maneuver. The film splits itself between clever and well performed slapstick gags, and Chaplin's somber reflections on his many mistakes and misfortunes. This structure is inherently difficult to gell together, yet for the most part it works pretty seamlessly. I can't possibly think of a structure to more appropriately match the life of Charlie Chaplin. However, where I do think the film missteps is in its cheese factor and artificial-ness. 

            <br><br>


            Chaplin (1992) is a super generic, artificial feeling film that wants you to have the "feels" more than you do. Starting off, did a film about Charlie friggen Chaplin have to be so generic? The guy is the most prolific filmmaker of all time but you'd never be able to tell from this film because his story is apparently the same as every other celebrity biography we've ever gotten. Guy is poor, guy makes it based on his talent, guy finds his vice (in Chaplin's case its women) and then guy is ostracized by society before being redeemed in the end. Boring. Another problem I have is, and I don't know if this is just the copy of the film I'm watching, but nearly every single line of dialogue sounded like it was being added in in post-production. I felt like very few of the lines performed for the camera were allowed to naturally exist in the finished product. But maybe I'm crazy. So instead let me pick on some of the brutal editing. There were so many weird cuts and swipes and fades that I found myself constantly taken out of the story because it felt like Attenborough had just discovered powerpoint transitions. Still, I enjoyed the film, and I did feel invested in Chaplin's story, but I cant't help but feel like the film was trying to force me to be more sad than I was. Like there would be moments where everything would just be fine and swell, maybe an upbeat comedy sequence, that would transition straight into a conversation where Charlie learns someone we saw for one minute half an hour ago died off screen. Then from there we get a five minute squence of sad music and Chaplin being somber over this person we hardly care about and don't understand why they meant so much to him.

            It really is a decently well made movie, considering the immense subject material to work with, but its also just super boring. There's nothing special about it other than the fact its about Chaplin. And even then you would think it would be at least a bit more spectacular! Its safe as safe can be with the best moments coming from the short comedy performances Chaplin does to entertain the audience within the film. Overall Attenborough's approach is just too ambitious I think. Chaplin (1992) is an attempt to stuff the life of a legendary director into two hours which is just impossible. Without either more time or a more pointed focus, this film was destined to be nothing more than "fine."
