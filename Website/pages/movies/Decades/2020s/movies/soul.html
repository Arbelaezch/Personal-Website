				Soul is a Pixar animated film that centers on jazz music and chasing your passions as a purpose in life. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was Pixar's first feature length film to not be given a wide theatrical release and was instead put directly onto Disney+. Despite this, the film has had a relatively decent box office. Soul was also a critical success holding a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes and earned Academy Awards for both Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score.

				<br><br>


				The Pixar of old created worlds that had never been possible to create before and used those settings to have adult and child alike empathise with characters and stories to move us in ways we didn't expect from a "kids movie." Of course this is a reductive view of much of the beauty of Pixar's films and what made them special, but at their hearts, they were telling stories in beautiful ways in an animated medium that hadn't been fully explored yet. The Pixar of the early 2000s was compared to Disney animated films that had largely been one dimensional fairy tales, which is partially why Pixar's films were such a revelation. 
				
				
				<br><br>
				
				With the rise of better alternatives to Disney and Pixar animated films, Pixar has found that their approach of telling good stories in novel settings began to lose their charm. Monsters University, Finding Dory, and Incredibles 2, like it or not, are all pretty similar in quality to their respective predecessors, and yet they don't hit that sweet spot that the originals did. This is because the landscape of animated films has changed drastically since a decade ago with so many other studios putting out good animated offerings, pushing the goal post for a transcendant animated picture that much farther. It is no longer enough to tell a good animated story in a fantastically creative world. Enter Soul.


				
				<br><br>
				
				Soul is a return to the Pixar that I loved as a kid. It still has an interesting animated setting, but the movie is not about that space. Soul instead uses existentialism to explore and blend many different story telling types and cliches into one seamless package. The film starts with an out of luck protagonist bored with his life and trying to catch a break, then the film shifts into a buddy travel story, then to a switched bodies trope. It's Soul's ability to perfectly dance amongst these many different stories, along with its fantastic characters, humor and world building that set it apart from so many others. Soul isn't a return to Pixar form just because it is a good animated movie. It's because it pushes forward storytelling in animated films in a way that Pixar hasn't done in ten years.
				
				<br><br>

				Beyond this, Soul does have a very heartfelt message with empathetic characters that draw you in to their struggles. The music is great. The animation is solid which goes to show you don't need the fanciest technology available to make a fantastic animated movie (I'm looking at you Toy Story 4). The performances are what you would expect from a Pixar film by this point. But still my favorite aspect of this film is its approach to existentialism and death and how it handles some of these basic philisophical concepts and puts them into bite sized chunks digestible by audiences in a CHILDREND's movie.

				<br><br>

				I loved this movie and recommend it to anyone, especially if you have lost faith in Pixar over the years. Don't expect an incredibly nuanced debate on any emotions or concepts presented, just roll with it, and you will have a good time. I will always have a sweet spot in my heart for Pixar classics but, in my opinion, Soul is the new bar to reach for any future animated films.
