				I have been looking forward to Minari for almost a year. The melancholy feel of the trailer and simplistic plotline captured me. And while I'm not exactly an A24 fanboy, I do enjoy a lot of their films and appreciate their strategy of trying things a little different. When excellent reviews began rolling in I became even more excited, if not a little concerned that maybe it wouldn't live up to my hype. Even with that incredible anticipation, it was completely satisfying and is easily one of my favorite films that I have seen in recent months.

				Like I said, Minari's simple, almost melancholy feel captured me and is part of the reason I love it so much. It's an intimate look at a charming family undergoing struggles that are wholly different from any other family drama I have ever seen. This film made farming exciting, as the entire family's livelihood rested upon it. I loved too how there was no antagonist in this film, except for maybe mother nature herself. Both the husband and wife, while constantly at odds, both just wanted what is best for their family and their future lives. You could always tell that despite the differences in opinion, these people truly cared about each other and it pained them to have to fight all the time.

				<br><br>

				A specific moment I really loved was a brief exchange between the young kids in church, where at least I as an audience member expected racial tensions to be introduced. The door is opened for a potential race struggle to occur, and then the movie subverts that expectation and has the kids become close friends afterwards. I was extremely excited to see that this movie didn't become about the racism a Korean family faces in the southern United States. Rather it focused on the challenges a poor Korean family might face within their family, and how they might also solve those same problems. This film sacrificed any discussion of racism, and in doing so was able to showcase Korean culture and family dynamics engaging and struggling with it's own dilemmas. This allows for Korean culture within the context of the film to be more than just a challenge to western culture, but it's own unique identity with it's own struggles, methods, and goals. I can't remember the last American film I watched that focused on another culture or people and allowed them to exist, not necessarily in an isolated environment away from western culture, but in parallel with it.

				<br><br>

				I loved this film. For me it is the perfect approach to addressing concerns about a Hollywood that is so entrenched in white western culture. Minari does not resent western culture or even attempt to take pity from it. Instead it becomes powerful and beautiful all on it's own.
