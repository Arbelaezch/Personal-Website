            No Time to Die is Craig's fifth and last Bond, and Bond's twenty-fifth outing. After being delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it finally released to an okay box office and generally favourable reviews. Though, as it is currently the most expensive Bond film ever made, this is probably not ideal. Also of note, due to changing political climate as to how women and people of color are portrayed on screen, there has been an additional spotlight on how a traditionally barbaric franchise like Bond would update to the times. Turns out, it did pretty well.

				<br><br>

				I wanna start by acknowledging that the Bond franchise comes with a lot of expectations and baggage, and the Craig movies especially have set a few new bars for the character in terms of expectation and quality. No Time to Die does a good job of meeting these expectations, while also making updates to its traditional formula to keep it fresh and in line with modern day values. It also manages to give a satisfying conclusion to Craig's tenure as Bond that not every franchise gets.
				
				<br><br>

				The big strength of this movie is the action. Director Fukanaga does a great job of showcasing tight, punchy action sequences where the tone is different depending on how on-top of it Bond is. There is a very different feeling when Bond is desparately fighting for his life versus almost mindlessly, or even bored, dispatching hostile threats. It makes for action sequences that can shift and blend into eachother without the audience getting overwhelmed or bored of it all.

				<br><br>

				As always in Bond movies, the story is the weak part. Rami Malek's villain is ultimately useless and one dimensional and its unfortunate. Ana de Armas presented an interesting possible side to Bond, but is replaced by Lashana Lynch who have far less chemistry together. I also lament the loss of the more interesting cinematography from both Skyfall (thank you papa Deakins) and Spectre. Both films felt more impressive than this one, though No Time to Die did have a few moments. In this movie, it felt like the camera was there to perfectly frame the action as opposed to the settings, which is fine, just not something I enjoyed quite as much. Finally, my last gripe is that Bond survives some pretty unsurvivable explosions, but compared with the number of situations he shouldn't have survived in Spectre, I'll let him have this one.

				<br><br>

				Overall, the film is a good, satisfying conclusion to Craig's Bond. It does nothing special from previous Bonds except for maybe update the formula to modern times as well as pack in some interesting punchy action. At nearly three hours long it will be hard to justify throwing the entire thing on. I'll probly just put on the action scene where Bond is climbing the stairs and call it a day.
