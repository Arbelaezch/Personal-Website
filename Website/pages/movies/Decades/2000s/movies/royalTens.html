			It's painful writing this review because I did not like The Royal Tenenbaums. From legendary director Wes Anderson comes one of his initial breakout films that put him on the map. Considered to be beginning of his signature style, Tenenbaums is just that. It is a beautiful, colorful film with wacky characters and an absurd plot like all great Anderson films. 
			
			<br><br>

			Unfortunately, this usual combination of elements didn't quite thrill me this time around. Maybe it's because I have become accustomed to a more refined verson of these Anderson qualities. Maybe it's because in 2001 when this film was released, this kind of style was new and fresh and it delighted people and since then Tenenbaums has grown older and more generic in a climate of posh, eclectic, youthful Netflix narratives. Maybe I'm just a dork who missed the point and should watch it a second time.

			<br><br>

			Regardless of the macro reasons for my not enjoying Tenenbaums on this watchthrough, there are still micro-reasons as to why I couldn't get into it. For one, and I'm sure this is a commonality among people that dislike the film, the incest plotline made me uncomfortable. Second, a racist, swindling, neglectful Gene Hackman had me feeling very little sympathy for him as a lead character. And finally, I just did not find the film all that funny. There were definitely a good number of moments that had me chuckling, but not nearly enough to make up for not really being emotionally engaged with any of the main family. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			All the actors did a fair job; I particularly liked Angelica Huston and Danny Glover, but that's probably just because they were the most likeable in the cast. Obviously the production design was beautiful and the cinematography delightfully staged. Regardless of whether I had a good time in Tenenbaums, Anderson's films are always a treat to watch.

			<br><br>

			I think if there is one takeaway I had from this viewing, it's that I went in with too high of an expectation. I look forward to hearing from people who truly love Tenenbaums, but I should have known I was getting into a film at the onset of a director's career, when their style hadn't been perfectly refined yet. Whether it is a film that is still enjoyed by people today, or his more recent pictures have blown it out of the water, I still had a good time going back to see where Anderson's legacy truly started.
