            No Country for Old Men is a Neo-Western by contemporary filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. It is regarded by critics as one of the greatest films ever made and won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also a major box office success that is commonly acknowledged as the Coen's magnum opus.

            <em>No Contry</em> is a divisive film among audiences, especially after a first viewing. It takes wild unexpected turns that are not only surprising, but also really frustrating. It took me a couple viewings and some serious reflection about what McCarthy and the Coens were trying to say until I could get over my dismay at the plot. Eventually, I came around to appreciate it as a beautiful dissection of the traditional Western that tackles the changing times in both Hollywood and real life crime. It looks and feels like a Western, with the cowboys and ten gallon hats, while also subverting many crucial cliches the genre is known for, such as the main character being killed off screen by a random. The entire film is about how times have changed and the world has become more and more wild and abstract to the point that Sheriff Bell played by Tommy Lee Jones retires, feeling lost and outmatched in this new seemingly random and evil world. The main antagonist Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem, is a walking embodiment of this random evil, as well as strict judgment, that makes him a sort of arbiter of this new world order of crime.

            So in my humble opinion this film is a masterpiece, theres just so much good to talk about. First off you got Cinematography genius Roger Deakons on the camera, bringing his signature realistic lighting to this bleak and grounded tale that perfectly matches the tone the Coens are going for. The cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh is fun and tense and even after seeing this film four times I still end up on the edge of my seat during their meeting in the hotel. Not to mention the myriad of tense scenes found throughout the film, I'm looking at you coin flip sequences. And this leads me to Chigurh. My god Bardem absolutely owns this film. Every second he's on screen you are just hooked. He is such a smart, yet loose cannon. Try as you might, you never really understand him and that's scary. I find myself hating him and respecting the hell out of him all at the same time. 

            <br><br>


            As is tradition with the Coens, each conversation is engaging. There's always something weirdly off about every random  side character that makes for engaging conversations that are fun and grounded in a way that, despite being so wacky, oddly feel real. The hilarious depictions of everyday people set on the backdrop of a cold, tense, calculated game of cat and mouse is a perfect mirror for the message of the film. The message that life, just like this film, is permeated by an absured randomness, as well as hard logical judgment.
