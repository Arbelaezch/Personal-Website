              The classic that began the Disney fairy tales legacy. Walt Disney Company had previously 
              produced plenty of Mickey Mouse shorts, such as Silly Symphonies but this was a major step up. 
              Snow White was a massively expensive movie that would have bankrupt Disney if it hadn't been a success. 
              Luckily for him it was a critical and commercial success. In fact it was so insanely successful 
              it broke the record for highest grossing sound film of all time, eventually
              displaced by Gone with the Wind in 1939.
              
             <br><br>

             To make Snow White, Disney used a multiplane camera to give the animation a three-dimensional feeling. 
             It ended up winning an oscar for being a "significant screen innovation" and 
             inspired the production of The Wizard of Oz.
            
             <br><br>

             A simple fairy tale story, but its simplicity adds to its charm and excitement.
             The animation is still very beautiful and colorful.
             The 3D makes it feel so real and the humour is still pretty funny actually. 
             Its a fun, simple tale that easily still holds up.
