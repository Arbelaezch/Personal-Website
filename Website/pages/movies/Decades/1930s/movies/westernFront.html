          <p> One of the early talkie War epics that fully showcases the harrowing struggles of war, and those who fight them.
            The film follows some of the young men who join the German military at the onset of WW1.
            Just like the men, the film is full of life until its not. The film was a major success both 
            critically and at the box office, winning Oscars for Best Picture and Direction. It was also 
            nominated for cinematography, and it certainly shows, making huge leaps in the scale of on-screen conflicts, 
            as well as in the action being shown. 
            <br><br>


            Its easy to see that many war films made today owe much of their structure 
            and content to this very early example of the genre. Its massive, and I really did enjoy it. 
            It starts to drag at certain points, but I love the first and the last thirds, and the big 
            set pieces are really quite incredible. Its also very sad in parts and I wasn't totally expecting that. 
            Overall the film is a kick to the gut that is still as impactful as its always been.
