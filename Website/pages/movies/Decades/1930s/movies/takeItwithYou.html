              Another Best Picture winner for Capra, and his third Best Director Oscar in five years. 
              Based off of a Pulitzer Prize winning play, You Can't Take it With You is a wholesome look at 
              American life for two different kinds of families, the rich and powerful, and those not so. 
              James Stewart is phenomenal even in this early hit of his, but to be honest I couldn't stand this 
              picture as a whole. It was just far too innocent and sappy for me. 
              
            

            <br><br>

            The Comedy/Romance doesnt hold as much weight as it maybe used to and now even 
            the narrative is just too happy go lucky for me. Before I continue I'll disclose that I could only stomach 
            the first half of the film before I shut it off. Maybe I'm wrong about it and things take a drastic turn 
            at some point but the way I see it continuing is a tale about how being a rich snob is bad and a happy go 
            lucky family that pays no taxes and doesn't go to work is good. 

            <br><br>

            Coming off of Mr. Deeds its clear that the two stories have their similarities, but for me a massive 
            difference is the focus of each film. Deeds focus' on the caring, stoic nature of its charasmatic lead 
            in Gary Cooper. Cooper nails it and by the end, regardless of how sappy the tale is I wanted him to be 
            successful. In You Can't Take it With You the focus rests on Jean Arthurs eccentric family, while 
            the charasmatic male lead takes a back seat. Their eccentricities 
            would be fine if there weren't so many members of the family. I found myself not caring about any one of them 
            as they acted almost like children. In a feel good picture about the lives and struggles of the working class, maybe at 
            least have them work? I identified more with the cruel yet rational rich who at least understood you need 
            money in order to live. 

            <br><br>

            I think Capra, and this play as a whole, just goes off the deep end in pandering to people in financially 
            unstable situations. It crosses over into the territory of proclaiming that being happy and foregoing work 
            and money is the ideal way to live, when in reality no poor person could ever survive this way.
