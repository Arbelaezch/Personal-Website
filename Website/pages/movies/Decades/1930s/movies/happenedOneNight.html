            This pre-code, Romantic Comedy is every bit as enjoyable as its always been. 
            The first film to win all five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, 
            and Best Adapted Screenplay. One of Frank Capra's early pictures cements him as a man who 
            knows how to make a hit. 
            The chemistry between stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is electric. 
            Colbert is hilariously bratty and Gable terrifically overconfident to a point where the two make 
            a duo that has since been replicated a hundred times over. Together they are hilarious and 
            adorable all at the same time.


              
             <br><br>

            Once filming was completed, star Colbert claimed to a friend "I just finished the worst picture in the world." 
            Overall the studio had low expectations for the film which is hilarious as it became Columbia's 
            biggest hit to date.


            <br><br>
            This romantic comedy really strikes a chord that few others can. Thanks to its performances it becomes relatable
             and absured all at the same time. Its funny and enjoyable and timeless like few other films of the 
             genre can be.
