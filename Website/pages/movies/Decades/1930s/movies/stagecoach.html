            Stagecoach is a legendary Western film about nine strangers travelling by stagecoach through Apache infested territory. 
            Its one of the early hits of legendary director John Ford's career, and was the breakthrough role for John Wayne. Initially 
            the film was going to be directed by notorious Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but he wanted Gary Cooper for the lead 
            over Wayne, and Ford wasn't having it. So instead Ford took his chances elsewhere in order to take a chance on Wayne. This was 
            also the first of many films Ford would go on to shoot in Monument Valley.

            The film achieved immediate critical and trade paper success, winning two Oscars for Best Music and Supporting Actor. 
            Its a phenomenal piece that tells a tale of regular American archetypes dealing with daily struggles. The human side of the 
            story grounds it for most the film's runtime, with only two shootouts occurring towards the end. The large carriage action 
            set piece is phenomenal and a real wonder to behold. Its intense and spectacular and is possibly one of my favorite in a 
            western. Not just because the effects are well done or the shots dynamic and beautiful, but because of the connections you've 
            built with these characters and because how much you don't want to see them killed, despite them being hopelessly outgunned.

            There is of course a darker side to this film that needs to be addressed. The film takes a hard stance 
            stereotyping and dehumanizing Native Americans. Any non-white people in the film are either ridiculed for being 
            savages or shot dead. These are of course not surprising politics coming from a John Ford picture, but they are 
            terribly outdated ways of looking at people and the world and still left a bad taste in my mouth. Despite these 
            transgressions, <em>Stagecoach</em> is still a masterclass in Western filmmaking.
