            The quintessential Adventure film. Errol Flynn's Robin Hood is the charasmatic hero archetype
            we no longer get in Hollywood because he has been emulated a million times. This is of course a compliment 
            to him. <em>Robin Hood</em> was the most expensive Warner Bros film to date at a wopping 
            $2M. It contains plenty of iconic imagery that is still replicated decades later, such as the hilariously 
            colorful costumes.

            <br><br>


            Its silly and over the top and hilariously positive. Its a perfect target to be made fun of and yet 
            its still charming and enjoyable. At first the frequent laughing was awkward to me but after a half 
            hour I was laughing along with it. Its a film that raises your spirits and invites you so convincingly 
            to take part in its cheer. That being said people get straight up murdered in here, and I think 
            it makes the action that much more enjoyable.


            <br><br>
           
            Though I enjoyed Robin Hood, it isn't quite my cup of tea. I'll always appreciate it, but it just doesn't 
            strike a chord with me that makes it any more than the simple adventure film it is.
