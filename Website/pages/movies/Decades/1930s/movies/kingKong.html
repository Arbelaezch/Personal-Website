              Unbenounced to me, King Kong (1933) was actually an original property! 
              Super creative and exciting, the music fits perfectly and boy oh boy do people 
              get straight up murdered in here. You can really tell its a Pre-Hayes Code film. 
              One point of disappointment is that, like the modern Peter Jackson King Kong, 1933 Kong filmed 
              a scene where crew members were being devoured by giant insects. This scene was removed 
              by RKO because they thought it too graphic and now the footage is lost forever. 
              
             <br><br>

             Very very impressive special effects. The stop motion is actually really solid with the janky movement 
             somehow elevating the dramatic tension in scenes. Kong also pioneered techniques like matte painting, 
             rear projection, and miniatures. You can tell a lot of care really went into the stop motion and effects of
              this picture. This is of course reinforced by stories like how the T-Rex fight took seven weeks to finish.

              <br><br>

              Honestly, I'm really into it. A ton of fun, still looks great and is really enjoyable. 
              The Peter Jackson Kong is basically a shot for shot remake, with just better special effects and a 
              little more character development. Maybe a few more set pieces, but all the best stuff 
              from the new one originated from here.
