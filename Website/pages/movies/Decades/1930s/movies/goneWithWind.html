            <br><br>
            

            -The Fall of the "Gallant" South
            -Second most expensive film of all time at $3.85M
            -wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), 
            Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African American to win an 
            Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.
            -Fleming also directed Wizard of Oz of the same year.
            -Black commentators criticized the film for its depiction of black people and as a glorification of slavery
            -A trend of denying the facts. Its fitting that the film itself romanticizes the old south and its past, 
            because everyone in this film romanticizes their lives. Scarlett refuses to listen to reality and hangs on to her 
            little girl ideals of loving Ashley Wilkes and shutting out the rest of the world. She literally shuts out the war 
            and Ashley's protests the same way young southern boys neglect their ill fit for war.
            -The only person who speaks in agreeance with reality is Clark Gable's Rhett Butler, who is seen as a spoiled gentleman. 
            This is because he refuses to accept and play by the same cultural rules as everyone else in the South. He chooses 
            to listen to reality rather than romanticize it.
            -Rhett and Scarlett are perfect for each other because they both care about themselves far more than for anyone else. 
            Butler at least recognizes this, while Scarlet may believe she does care about others. Truth is she doesn't even really 
            care about the man she loves. She doesnt listen when he doesnt say he loves her, and doesnt care about his baby or his 
            wife or interests.
            -Swaggering and boasting
            -Bad lots both of us. selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names.
            -Hattie McDaniel was also absent, as she and the other black cast members were prevented from attending the premiere due 
            to Georgia's Jim Crow laws, which kept them from sitting with their white colleagues.
            -The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment of its initial reception by acknowledging that while it was the most 
            ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be 
            an "interesting story beautifully told".
            -Vivien Leigh in particular being singled out for her performance as Scarlett
            -Scarlett from spoiled selfish to determined to do what needs to be done to be successful
            -Scarlett the picture of the fallen south? Disbelief until defeated, then picks itself up by its bootstraps to do 
            what needs to be done. The true death of the Old South. She abandons their ideals.
            -a "social propaganda" film offering a "white supremacist" view of the past.
