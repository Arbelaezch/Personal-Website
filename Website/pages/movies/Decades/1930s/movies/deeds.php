                A simple, small town man inherits a massive fortune, making him the target for 
                scammers and publicity-seekers. Overwhelmed by the turn his life has taken, and 
                awoken to another use for his new-found fortune, he makes a momentous decision.<br><br>

          <p>

            Capra's biggest box office hit to date, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is a feel good romantic comedy 
            that puts a larger emphasis on the Feel Good than the Romantic Comedy. Star of the show 
            Gary Cooper is cool as a cucumber as Longfellow Deeds who inherits a light $20M from an unknown relative
             (almost $400M by today's standards). Personally I loved watching Cooper play the good hearted, soft spoken 
             Deeds. His down to earth demeanor made those attempting to swindle him all the more horrendous. 
             Female lead Jean Aurthur is not quite as good, actually annoying me at times, but she actually doesn't 
             get a lot of screen time so its not a big sin.
              
            

            <br><br>

            The Comedy and Romance angles fell a little short of great for me, but thats alright because the 
            emotional feel good narrative, along with Cooper's stoic charm, was more than enough to keep me watching. 
            While the film's politics play out in a shockingly black and white manner, it still gave me the warm 
            and fuzzies. To me this film did what it set out to do perfectly well, and I really enjoyed it. 
            And just like that Capra has another hit under his belt.
