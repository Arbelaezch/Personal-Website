              So either I'm not a big Screwball Comedy fan or I just do not like this film. 
              Its quick and wacky and absolutely absurd but I just cannot engage myself in any of it. 
              I know I've gotta turn off my brain to enjoy wacky comedies, but every unbelievable 
              situation and misunderstanding just makes it that much harder for me to rationalize any of it. 
              This isn't like the Marx brothers where everything happens in a ludicrous fever pitch of comedy. 
              This is an attempt at a genuine fast paced comedic narrative that makes no sense.

            Maybe part of it is that I just cannot stomach Cary Grant as a neurotic professor. The guy is a great actor, 
            but not in this. Nearly everytime he talks I think to myself how much he seems to be trying to be neurotic. 
            This is just not his role.



            <br><br>

            That being said there are still some genuinely funny moments in here. I'm not a total stickler to its 
            charm, just mostly a stickler. The thing this movie did the best was made me fall in love with Katharine 
            Hepburn, who does a phenomenal job being a quick witted, nearly flighty heiress.
