				Fun Fact: It took Kurt Russell a full year to grow his hair to its signature length for the film.

			 <em>The Thing (1982)</em> is an isolationist horror adaptation of the novella <em>Who Goes There?</em> by John W. Campbell, which had already been adapted by Howard Hawkes in the 1951 film <em>The Thing from Another World</em>. Coming off of his monumental success in <em>Halloween (1978)</em> and <em>Escape from New York (1981)</em>, and spurred on by Ridley Scott's massively successful <em>Alien (1979)</em>, director John Carpenter was given his largest budget to date for The Thing. In fact the fifteen million dollar price tag was more than Universal had ever spent on a monster film. Unfortunately, the film did not fare well with audiences and ended its theatrical run with a paltry twenty million. This is partly due to it opening against other film behemoths like E.T., Blade Runner, and Poltergeist, the R-rating, and the fact that American audiences were already oversaturated and tired of Sci-Fi and Horror genre films. Critically the film was also regarded quite poorly, being labelled a boring, excessively gory flick. This failure ruined Carpenter's burgeneoning career as he remarked in a 2011 interview: "If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different." Since then, <em>The Thing</em> has become a cult classic and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films of all time.

			 Now that the history lesson is out of the way, lets talk about these creature effects.

			 <br><br>
			
			 The year is 1982 and the first on screen computer generated characters are still three years off. So, how do you create a realistic looking alien thats going to scare the pants off your audience? You have to make it practical, aka you have to build probs. You have to build lots of probs. Enter twenty-one year old special effects artist, Rob Bottin. Due to the horror films of his childhood, Carpenter intentionally did not want to make his alien a "guy in a suit," and so Bottin obliged. Bottin lived on the Universal set for a year without taking a single day off in order to came up with and build some absolutely disgusting alien forms and creations. He chose vivid, exotic colors to make his creatures look revolting and different in order to both grip and scare audiences. He, along with his team of thirty five, created some of the most impressively horrifying practical effects ever filmed. Watching this film today it is hard to believe they really built everything you see and that they found ways of lighting and filming it so that you, as an audience member, believe it is real.

			 <br><br>

			 Going beyond in-your-face special effects, the film has a thrilling sense of horror to it as well. The story involves an alien that can shapeshift and take on any human form it chooses, so the film plays on the paranoia and mistrust of not knowing who the real humans are. Carpenter plays on this unseen dramatic tension expertly. The film leaves you wary of everyone you are watching, never really letting you relax in knowing that any of the characters is one hundred percent safe. The ending is also a beautifully ambiguous follow through of the entire film's themes. All of the performances are also well done with Kurt Russell being the obvious highlight. And the music is composed by my personal hero Ennio Morricone so you know its that masterpiece shit.

			 <br><br>

			 If I did have any complaint with the film, it would be that I do wish there was a way, watching it back, to actually be able to determine the moments that specific characters are infected throughout the film. To me that would have been a nice addition for rewatch value, but I've seen this thing a dozen times so clearly its got some rewatch factor going for it. It's also too bad that the studio, at the last minute, decided to change the official poster to a typical "slasher guy," completely undercutting Carpenter's entire attempt to circumvent that genre trope. This is also why I went with a bit more of a stylized poster for this website.

			 
			 <br><br>

			 Overall, <em>The Thing</em> is a classic horror film that I think is one of the most consistently enjoyable film experiences I have. It's a masterfully made film that finally gets the respect it deserves and if you haven't watched it yourself, I obviously don't recommend it at all it actually sucks.
