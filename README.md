This current iteration of my website is built with a Django backend and hosted using a DigitalOcean Linux droplet. Gunicorn is the application server while Nginx handles web requests. Static files are served by WhiteNoise and Postgres is used for both my dev and prod databases as per [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity).

Since 2020 I've spent more than a hundred hours of my life overengineering this website that gets maybe one visitor every twelve months and has very little dynamic content because it has been an invaluable teacher.

Because of the time I've invested, I have learned countless lessons in both full-stack and general software development. When I started this website I had no design experience, I had only passing familiarity with HTML/CSS, and I still thought buying a domain was all I needed in order to access my website online. Some of the things I have learned from this project include:
    * HTML/CSS/JS (for real)
    * Responsive Design
    * Database Management (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL)
    * Environment variables and secrets
    * Web servers, specifically Nginx
    * Application servers, specifically Gunicorn
    * Linux server management
    * SSL certificates
    * DNS management
    * CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)

Other technologies I worked with over the many iterations of this project include:
    * Docker
    * Serverless Functions (Google Cloud Run, AWS Lambda)
    * Cloud Hosting (Azure App Service, AWS EC2, Digital Ocean droplets)
    * Static file hosting (Firebase Storage, AWS S3, WhiteNoise)

Anyway, thank you for checking out my code and (maybe) my website. Feel free to shoot me a message at arbelaezch@gmail.com if you wanna chat or provide constructive criticism. I always appreciate new opportunities to learn more about my craft.
